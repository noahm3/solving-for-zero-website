      <div class="prose prose-lg">
        <p>"Solving for Zero" is a podcast hosted by Noah Megregian that explores climate solutions from both long-term systemic and short-term economic perspectives.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Every industry on earth is being reimagined to solve climate change, and most people haven't even noticed. While many focus on the scary headlines and doomsday scenarios, we're interested in the good stuff - what people are doing every day to solve climate change.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What We Cover</h2>
        <p>Our podcast explores two key perspectives:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The Long Term Perspective</strong> - We focus on the system. The way society functions today has to change in order to transition to a sustainable world. We bring on experts in policy, science, and more to explore what specifically has to change and what it looks like when we're done.</li>
          <li><strong>The Short Term Perspective</strong> - In today's paradigm, for a climate solution to be truly scalable, the economics need to support it. We engage with leaders of climate tech organizations, diving into their economics, product-market fit, scalability, and impact to uncover the innovations that are disrupting industries to bring about the transition.</li>
        </ol>
